### The Reboot

**Today's Progress**
 - Studying Bootstrap 4

**Thoughts:**
  After failing the challenge the first time, I realized how hard the challenge was - saying is one thing,
  actually doing it is another story. Experiencing defeat just made me more energized to complete this

### Documentation

**Thoughts:**
So far so good, I'm liking the whole documentation that's been going on with this challenge.
I'm slowly seeing effects and picking things up faster.
Makes me really inspired to be a programmer.
